# Learn-Ruby-The-Hardway
Learn ruby the hardway exercise file.

I started to learn programming because of my illness, well for me, its not an illness, its a give. I have Bipolar BTW. 
So for those who never heard about Bipolar, simple to say, its some kind of mood disorder. 
For normal people, who doesn't have any mood disorder, their mood got 3 stage, "Happy", "ok" and not "ok".
But for me, i have only 2 stage. "Extremely Happy" and "Extremely depress".

So, my mood is not under my control anymore....
For so many years, i don't think i can't feel "normal" again,
until one day, when i have trouble at works (currently i dont go to work..) i started teaching myself programming.
Thanks to learnrubythehardway.org, i have a purpose in my life now - To be a programmer..

So, enough chit chat... lets help each other learn ruby.
